I want to get more into reading! I hope having a little page dedicated to it will help motivate me a little more.

### Chainsaw Man
**Ch 156/Ongoing - Rating: 7/10** *Started: 06/02/23*
<br>It's a fun read, but I really enjoyed arc 1 much more over arc 2. I feel arc 2 has been very slow, which while it works for the story that's being told, it's just not my thing. Regardless of how I feel about the story, I still like reading the new chapter every Tuesday!

### Laika's Comet
**Ch 8/Ongoing - Rating: 10/10** *Started: 23/12/23*
<br>**GO READ LAIKA'S COMET** It's such a cute story!! I love the characters and I love their designs so much and the story is coming along to be SO interesting!! I think my favourite character is Mars, they're so silly and cute!! I can't wait to see more story beats be revealed.

### Devil's Candy
**Ch 1/Ongoing - Rating: ?/10** *Started: 26/02/24*
<br>My friend gifted this to me! I've only read the first chapter so I'm not going to rate it just yet. But I've really enjoyed it so far, it reminds me a lot of RWBY! It's really cute, and the character designs are wonderful!
