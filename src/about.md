    Hello! Thank you so much for checking out my website, and thank you even more for checking out my about me! My username online is nonkiru, but my actual name is Emma! I live in *very* rural Australia. It's nice to meet you, internet adventurer.

    I have this little ramble on every interation of my site, so here is it again. I think my favourite thing about the indie web is the idea of someone stumbling onto this many years into the future. I hope the future is a kind and happy place. But if it isn't, I hope my little website brings you some joy!

    My hobbies include art, coding, gaming and sewing. I also love playing Tabletop RPGs with my friends! My favourite game is Final Fantasy XIV. *(I'm Myuri Nohn, on Tonberry! If you see me, say hi!)*
    I'm also a freelance artist as my work. I do lots of art commissions!

My favourite things include...
- Vocaloid Music and Producers
- Final Fantasy XIV
- Animal Crossing
- Art & Coding
- My OCs

## FAQ
<b>Q. How did you learn to make a website?</b>
<br><b>A.</b> To be honest, I think it started around 2014 with DeviantART and being able to edit your profile boxes on there. It's really hard for me to pinpoint what actually helped me learn - I think it was mostly repetition. In saying that, though, if *you* want to learn how to make one, feel free to reach out and I'll provide any tips I can!

<br>

<b>Q. Can I use your website as a base?</b>
<br><b>A.</b> My website is **not a base.** I would prefer that you use it as inspiration! <a href="https://copyheart.org/manifesto/">Copying is an act of love. Please copy.</a> 
<br>*However:* If you use anything, *especially* artwork, please credit me, <a href="https://nonkiru.art">nonkiru</a>!
<br>I'd also ask that you don't use art of my fursona; just because that's me, and I think that'd be really weird?

<br>

<b>Q. What programs do you use to make things?</b>
<br><b>A.</b> I use Visual Studio Code for coding, Clip Studio Paint for illustrations, and Aseprite for pixel art.
<br>

<br>

<b>Q. Are you LGBTQIA+ or Queer?</b>
<br><b>A.</b> Yes! You can probably tell by the lesbian cursor trail that I identify as a lesbian. For my gender though... um, I like kissing women?
<br><small>(I would probably say non-binary is close enough.)</small>

## Fursona
I have a fursona because I think they're really fun and silly. I also think that, generally, furry designs tend to be a bit more fun than human designs.
<br><br>The floating pixel pagedoll is my fursona too! Their name is Non and they are a housecat, based vaguely off of a Ragdoll / Burmese. I also get to live vicariously through them, since one day I really want to wear Lolita fashion!
<br><br>This is their reference sheet! 
<br>You're welcome to draw them, and I will love you forever if you do!
<img src="../assets/img/non sheet.webp" style="width: 100%;" alt="A reference sheet for the site owner's fursona. Text reads: Non, They/Them. Notes: They are fat, please draw them fat!! They are a cat. :3">
<br>I also have a <a href="https://toyhou.se/23516905.non">Toyhouse page</a> for them.
