Hello, and thank you for stopping by my little website on the world wide web! I'm a digital artist. It's nice to meet you, internet traveler!

I've always admired the indie web! I wanted to make my own little site too. I think the idea of how this site could be stumbled upon many years in the future is really neat! I hope the future is a nice place to you, but if it isn't, I hope my funny little site can cheer you up!

I have a lot of hobbies, but currently I'm into digital art, archery, and reading. I've also been getting into sewing and journalling! My favourite game is Final Fantasy XIV. I do freelance digital art as work.

This site was created by me by hand! For further details, though:

- Coded using Visual Studio Code
- Built using [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) static site generator
- Deployed via Git using [deploy-to-neocities](https://github.com/bcomnes/deploy-to-neocities)
