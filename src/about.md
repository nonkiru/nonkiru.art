    Hello! Thank you so much for checking out my website, and thank you even more for checking out my about me! My username online is nonkiru, but my actual name is Emma! I live in *very* rural Australia. It's nice to meet you, internet adventurer.

    I have this little ramble on every interation of my site, so here is it again. I think my favourite thing about the indie web is the idea of someone stumbling onto this many years into the future. I hope the future is a kind and happy place. But if it isn't, I hope my little website brings you some joy!

    My hobbies include art, coding, gaming and sewing. I also love playing Tabletop RPGs with my friends! My favourite game is Final Fantasy XIV. *(I'm Myuri Nohn, on Tonberry! If you see me, say hi!)*
    I'm also a freelance artist as my work. I do lots of art commissions!
