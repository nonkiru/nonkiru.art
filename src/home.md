Hello hello, world wide web adventurer!! (❁´◡`❁) 
<br>Welcome to my little website on the internet! I'm known as *nonkiru*, and it's nice to meet you.
<br><br>I hope you have a nice time exploring my site! 
<br>You can either use the navigation to the left, or use my <a href="/sitemap/">sitemap</a>. 

Most of the art and code on this site was made by me, but anything else will be <a href="/credits/">credited here</a>!

<b>Notice!</b> This website <i>currently</i> has a [Web14](http://www.mabsland.com/Adoption.html) rating.

<b>06 November 2023</b>
<hr>

Big update! Added the <a href="/ocs/">OCs</a> directory for my OCs! Added <a href="/ocs/myuri/">Myuri Nohn</a>, <a href="/ocs/billie/">Billie Tae-Gloria</a>, <a href="/ocs/jupiter/">Jupiter Scottson</a>, <a href="/ocs/estelle/">Estelle Linne</a> and <a href="/ocs/donnie/">Donnie Linne</a>. Also added a silly cursor trail. Also added back <a href="/resources/">Resources</a>.

<b>01 November 2023</b>
<hr>

Updated <a href="/ffxiv/myuri/">Myuri's</a> page with a short post. Added some more pages to <a href="/links/">Links</a>.

<b>29 October 2023</b>

Very big update! Updated the layout pretty significantly. Pixels are now x1, font is a bit smaller, general layout is different, navigation links now have custom icons, and more!

<b>28 October 2023</b>
<hr>

Removed the Weblisting/Webring page because some of them broke when I moved them, and I really didn't want to have to contact the webring owners to fix my links, so...

<b>23 October 2023</b>
<hr>

Updated the <a href="/ffxiv/">FFXIV</a> and <a href="/ffxiv/myuri">Myuri</a> page.

<b>21 October 2023</b>
<hr>

Added a <a href="https://thoughts.nonkiru.art/">Microblog</a>.

<b>20 October 2023</b>
<hr>

Added freezeframe (the GIF play/pause) function. It's enabled by default. Also split the <a href="/links/">Links</a> page to now have <a href="/webrings_weblistings/">Webrings/Weblistings</a> seperate due to long load times. I know what webring is causing it, but I can't do anything about it.

<b>18 October 2023</b>
<hr>

Created the <a href="/ffxiv/">FFXIV</a> page. Added new art to the <a href="/art_2023/">2023 Gallery</a> page.

<b>14 October 2023</b>
<hr>

Added new art to the <a href="/art_2023/">2023 Gallery</a> page.

<b>12 October 2023</b>
<hr>

Added new art to the <a href="/art_2023/">2023 Gallery</a> page, and added a new webring (pending). Also added back the <a href="/layouts/">Layouts</a> page and the <a href="/layouts/cheesecake/">Cheesecake Layout</a> page.

<b>11 October 2023</b>
<hr>

Finished the <a href="/art/">Art</a> page and added the <a href="/art_2023/">2023 Gallery</a> page.

<b>10 October 2023</b>
<hr>

Added a lace border and some other .css adjustments.

<b>09 October 2023 #2</b>

Hello, new website! I'm officially back on Neocities.
I managed to deploy this via Github and I'm really proud of myself for that! This is also my first finished SSG site. I'm really happy right now!

<h2>A Retrospective Into FFXIV ⁑ Endwalker Savage</h2>
<div style="height: 10rem; -webkit-mask-image: linear-gradient(180deg, #000 60%, transparent);">

**Contains Spoilers for FFXIV: Endwalker and the Pandæmonium raid series.**

This is my first blog post, so apologies if this is written weird or anything. I thought a neat blog post would be to talk about Pandæmonium savage!
<br>A small note before we begin, this post will likely be **updated when I fully complete P12S**. I took a break after P11S, so I only have thoughts up to about halfway through P12SP1.
<br>Additionally, clear dates are from my FFLogs and may not be fully accurate.
<br>Also, this is likely going to be the first Savage tier I fully clear (again, I'm not done quite yet) so keep that in mind while you read my rambles.
