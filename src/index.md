Started work on nonkiru version silly! I've been doing a lot of style experimentation, specifically with my art style! I think it looks really cute and pretty! Unfortunately I'm an extreme people-pleaser, so I always worry and hope that other people like my work too... so in saying that, I hope you like this new layout!! (´▽`ʃ♡ƪ)

## Filling in the Living Dex

Hello friends! This is less of a one-off blog post and more so a journal that I'll contiuously update.
<br>As stated by the title, this is my journey in attempting to fill in the Living Pokédex, which as of March 13 2024, is 1025 Pokémon!

Back in November of 2022 I completed the Pokédex in my copy of Scarlet, and ever since, I've been kinda itching to do something a bit grander. Finally finishing a Pokédex in any Pokémon game has always been a dream of mine, and this is just one step further!

I'll be doing this by using various games I own and making a full collection in Pokémon Home!

I have a few rules - or guidelines - for this challenge!

- No hacking, the Pokémon must be legal
- Trading is allowed, including the GTS
- Only games I own
- I want a copy of each Pokémon in the box, not just the Pokédex entry
