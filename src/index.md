# Welcome!

Hello and welcome to <a href="/">nonkiru.art</a>!

This site uses <b>Javascript</b> for Light/Dark toggle, and to Play/Pause GIFs. Each page has a button for these functions. 
<br>On this page, they are at the bottom of this div.

This site was also made for Firefox, with 1920 x 1080 resoultion in mind, but has also been tested on Edge with mutliple different resolutions.
This site is also <b>fully compatible with mobile devices</b>, but was made with PC in mind first.

While there is nothing NSFW/adult on this website, this site was created by an adult with a mature audience in mind.
