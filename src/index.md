started work on nonkiru version silly! i've been doing a lot of style experimentation, specifically with my art style! i think it looks really cute and pretty! unfortunately i'm an extreme people-pleaser, so i always worry and hope that other people like my work too... so in saying that, i hope you like this new layout!!
