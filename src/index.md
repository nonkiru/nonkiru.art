Hello hello, world wide web adventurer!! (❁´◡`❁)
<br>Welcome to my little website on the internet! I'm known as *nonkiru*, and it's nice to meet you.
<br><br>I hope you have a nice time exploring my site!
<br>You can either use the navigation to the left, or use my <a href="/sitemap/">sitemap</a>.

Most of the art and code on this site was made by me, but anything else will be <a href="/credits/">credited here</a>!

<b>Notice!</b> This website <i>currently</i> has a [WebPG](http://www.mabsland.com/Adoption.html) rating. 
<br><i>However</i>, this is likely to change to Web14+ in the future.
