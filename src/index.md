## Updates

<br>
Edited the sidebar to be a little easier to add new links to. The images were cute, but unfortunately not very sustainable in the long-term!
<br>Added page [Reading](/reading/).
<br>Added Javascript to the mobile menu - should be much nicer to browse.

Started work on nonkiru version silly! I've been doing a lot of style experimentation, specifically with my art style! I think it looks really cute and pretty! Unfortunately I'm an extreme people-pleaser, so I always worry and hope that other people like my work too... so in saying that, I hope you like this new layout!! (´▽`ʃ♡ƪ)

Over my years on the indie web, a common criticism I've seen is about websites that only exist for the "aesthetic": basically sites that have little content other than looking pretty. I've seen so much disdain for these sorts of sites, and I find it really quite silly.

My question to this critique is: Why are simple sites like these a problem? Personally, I don't see an issue with them at all!
