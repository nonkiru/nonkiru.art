Started work on nonkiru version silly! I've been doing a lot of style experimentation, specifically with my art style! I think it looks really cute and pretty! Unfortunately I'm an extreme people-pleaser, so I always worry and hope that other people like my work too... so in saying that, I hope you like this new layout!! (´▽`ʃ♡ƪ)

Over my years on the indie web, a common criticism I've seen is about websites that only exist for the "aesthetic": basically sites that have little content other than looking pretty. I've seen so much disdain for these sorts of sites, and I find it really quite silly.

My question to this critique is: Why are simple sites like these a problem? Personally, I don't see an issue with them at all!

I find that a lot of the people who have had this critique in the past use it as a way to downplay the effort that others put into their websites. Sure, seeing another pink and sanrio-themed site may get old after the 10th time, but someone still put effort into it. It still looks pretty. It still made someone happy to create. Or another Y2K website with a similar layout to all the other ones - but do you blame people for being inspired by Y2K designs? They look *good*! [1] This even applies to common traits you see in a *lot* of Neocities sites. Such as similar font choices (MS Gothic especially) or graphics (I see a lot from [FOOL LOVERS](https://foollovers.com/)) or even page layouts and design choices.
