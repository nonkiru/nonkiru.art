This website's goal, for accessibility, is to meet the minimum for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA.
<br><br>
This site has been checked using both [WAVE Tool](https://wave.webaim.org/) and [Axe-Core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core) which both come back without any accessibility issues. However, as I'm not someone who uses any accessibility tools for website-browsing, I can't confirm if there aren't further issues that the tools didn't pick up. If you have trouble with accessibility in regards to this website, please feel free to <a href="mailto:nonkiru@gmail.com">email me</a>.

## Site Features:
- Dark/light mode toggle for all pages.
- Mobile-responsive.
- Alt text for all non-decorative images.
- Zooming in/out doesn't break the layout.
- Uses [Atkinson Hyperlegible](https://brailleinstitute.org/freefont) for all non-header font.
- Fully accessibile with just a keyboard.
- Semantic HTML.
- Ability to pause/play all GIFs.


## Might-Work Features:
- A screen reader *could* work fully? Maybe?


## Planned Features:
- None currently.

## Final Notes
This website was made with Firefox, at 1920x1080 resolution in mind.
<br>This site uses Javascript for the theme changer and the gif play/pause function.
<br>Certain widgets may also require Javascript.
<br>Certain widgets may have accessibility issues that I am unable to change.
