This website's goal, for accessibility, is to meet the minimum for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA.

This site has been checked using both [WAVE Tool](https://wave.webaim.org/) and [Axe-Core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core) which come back without any accessibility issues. However, as I'm not someone who uses any accessibility tools, I can't confirm if there aren't further issues that the checkers didn't pick up. 

If you have trouble with accessibility in regards to this website, please feel free to <a href="mailto:nonkiru@gmail.com">email me</a>.

## Site Features:
- Dark/light mode toggle for all pages.
- Mobile-responsive.
- Alt text for all non-decorative images.
- Zooming in or out doesn't break the layout.
- Uses [Atkinson Hyperlegible](https://brailleinstitute.org/freefont) for all non-header font.
- Fully accessibile with just a keyboard.
- Semantic HTML.
- Flashing and blinking GIFs are hidden behind a dropdown.


## Might-Work Features:
- A screen reader should work fully, but I'm unable to test this.


## Planned Features:
- None currently.
