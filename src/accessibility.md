This website's goal, for accessibility, is to meet the minimum for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA.
<br><br>
This site has been checked using both [WAVE Tool](https://wave.webaim.org/) and [Axe-Core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core) which both come back without any accessibility issues. However, as I'm not someone who uses any accessibility tools for website-browsing, I can't confirm if there aren't further issues that the tools didn't pick up. If you have trouble with accessibility in regards to this website, please feel free to <a href="mailto:nonkiru@gmail.com">email me</a>.
