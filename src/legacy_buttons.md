Here are all the buttons I've used! Please only use the latest version of my button.
<br>*(No issue if you haven't gotten around to updating it yet though!)*

I wanted a pair of buttons that use my current fursona, which is a kitty! I also wanted two versions; one for each of my website's themes.
<br>Feel free to use the one you like more!

I used this button for nearly a year! I'm pretty proud of how it looks still, so I don't mind seeing it everywhere still.
<br>The small button was made by my friend, <a href="https://arunyi.art/">Arunyi</a>!
