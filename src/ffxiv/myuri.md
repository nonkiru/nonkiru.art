Hello! I'm Myuri Nohn, an adventurer from Eorzea. 
<br>My main jobs are Scholar, Black Mage and Dancer.
<br><br>
I started my journey on the 27th of November, 2016! I play on the Tonberry server. 
<br>Here are some screenshots from my journey!

The new patch came out today, and I had a lot of fun! I won 5 Blunderville events so I feel really proud of myself. I joined a few of my friends too, and we all had fun together! I also reached rank 20 in my Island Sanctuary, and I unlocked the gearset I really wanted. I took a screenshot to celebrate! <br>

<br>The little guy on my shoulder is Muffin, my Sponge Silkie! He is my best friend, and he travels all over Hydaelyn with me.
<br>Anyway, I know, short post. But I had fun, so I wanted to really quickly share that!
