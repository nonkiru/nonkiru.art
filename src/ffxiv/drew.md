Greetings, fellow adventurer!
<br>I am Drew N. Bellflower, the owner of this journal. I hope you stumble across this in good health (and I hope you did not find this on my person). I shall be using this to record all my various deeds and travels.
<br><br>
I shall not ramble on further, friend. Let us enjoy this journey together.
<br><br>

## First Travels
10/14 & 10/15
<br>I started my journey in the city state of Gridania, with my dear companion, Nasha Westknight. She's a dear and lovely girl, if not a bit... airheaded at times. I am also joined by my little critter of a friend, Poppyseed.
<br><br>
Nasha and I kept ourselves busy with adventuring-work; mostly just little quests and jobs here and there. I suppose they don't give hard jobs to fresh adventurers, but I cannot lie; I was hoping for something more exciting.
<br><br>
Nasha is happy, though, so I am happy too.
