Hello, and thank you again for checking out my website.

## Technical Information
- Created using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) static site generator.
- Coded using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- Hosted on [Neocities](https://neocities.org) via [Deploy to Neocities](https://deploy-to-neocities.neocities.org/).
- Public on Github (when I figure out how to do it sorry LMAO)

## Why I made a Website
I thought it would be fun. It's been really enjoyable to learn how to code, too. I feel super proud of how far I've come; I only need to search for help some of the time now! Not that there's anything bad for looking for help. But it's really nice to just know how to do it, y'know?
<br><br>
I also think websites are a reflection of the self. I wonder what you think of me from my website...
I hope you think I'm epic! Or at least okay. Or neat.

## Special Thanks
My girlfriend, [Zombiejynx](https://zombiejynx.neocities.org) for always supporting me. üåôüíû
<br>My friends, for entertaining me when I ramble about coding again.
