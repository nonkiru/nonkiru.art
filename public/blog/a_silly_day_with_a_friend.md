## A Silly Day with a Friend

<br>Hi friends!

Today I hung out with one of my friends, [Ladetisk](https://sheezy.art/ladetisk)! We bought some canvases and some bubble tea, and then went to go paint!

Also, we forgot to bring water for the paint, so we had to use my bubble tea's icecubes.

Whoops.

For our first paintings, we decided to do a little swapping game! Every 10 or so minutes, we'd swap canvases, and then go back and forth. 
<br>It took us about an hour, but these are our final paintings! (+ An extra one I painted for fun.)

<br>*(I added the iconic "nonkiru moon" to her painting. I had to. 
<br>(Don't tell anyone but it started off as a sun. Looks cooler as a moon, though.))*
<br>The one I started with was the bunny. I took that one home with me too.
<br>I also painted my WoL (FFXIV character)!

They're not perfect, but I'm happy with how everything turned out!

Anyway, I had a lot of fun today!<br>
Thank you for reading, and I hope you have a silly and fun day today too!! ^_^ <3
