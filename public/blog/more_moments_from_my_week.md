Hello friends! I'm back with another ramble about my week. Though honestly, this is closer to about a month... I'll keep this preramble short and sweet ~ so umm. Yeah!!

# Archery
So over this last """week""" (more like a month I am a liar!!) I've gotten into archery! My dad bought himself a longbow and I really wanted to try it out, so I did!
Um... turns out, when the bow is the same length as your height (155cm-ish), and has a draw weight WAY above your strength (35lbs) it... turns it into a bit of a struggle...

I kept trying it though! I was really getting into it, and it was so much fun. It was, however, really frustrating that a lot of my form issues couldn't be properly fixed. I couldn't draw it back properly because it was too heavy of a draw AND it was too long for me.

However, for Christmas, my parents surprised me with my OWN bow!

*Sorry that it's a bit hard to see against my bed...*

It's been SO much fun! My form is actually correct now! This is also been the most exercise I've gotten for like, 3 years. It's been making me feel a lot more alive. It also makes me wanna draw my fursona with a bow...

# Getting Back Into Wizard101
I swear I can't stay away from this game! They recently had free Membership during the 12 Days of the Spiral, so I decided 'oh why not!!'.

**I should not listen to the Devil on my shoulder.** I have been addicted ever since!! I also roped two of my friends into playing it with me.

Anyway, its been tons of fun! I left off in the beginning of Lemuria, so I'm currently working on finishing that world up. I'm on the last zone of Lemuria now! I've been soloing everything with a few exceptions. I don't know if I'll be able to also solo the final fight, but I'll give it a go. Soloing on Life isn't... terrible? But it's also a very slow way to solo.

Otherwise, I've been helping my friends with gearing and getting gold! My dream is to farm endgame gear with them. I have horrible social anxiety in THIS game specifically, so I haven't really done much on my main...

# Finishing up Spyro: Reignited Trilogy
I got this game back when it came out (2019...) as a birthday present from my Mum. I finished Spyro 2 almost as SOON as I got it; as that's the game I grew up with! I started Spyro 3, and then picked it up again after about a year. I finished Spyro 3 soon after that, and then I just... didn't touch the game for a while? I remember I started Spyro 1 at some point, but this week I picked it back up to finish it fully.

I've collected all Skill Points and all Steam Achievements, as well as collecting all the in-game stuff! I'm really proud of myself, Spyro is my favourite game series EVER!! (One of my usernames as a child was a reference to Spyro!!)

One of these days I really wanna 100% A Hero's Tail. I remember playing that one with my parents a lot, too!
I'd also like to fully finish The Legend of Spyro: Dawn of the Dragon. Fun fact, I named one of my childhood cats after Cynder! (My parents spelled it Cinder, but shhh. Baby me knew the truth.)

# Presents and Crafting
One of my dear IRL friends gifted me some stuff for the Holidays!

*(Sorry for blurring out my monitor. I don't want you reading my Discord messages!!)*

She got me a 3D bookend (that you need to assemble yourself, like a puzzle!) and a cute little dragon figurine. This is my first time ever putting something like this together, so I was super excited about it!

It's at this moment, however, that I got a little nervous. That's a LOT of pieces, and looking through the manual didn't help!
However, I was confident to succeed!

If you're looking *in* to the book, this here is part of the left side complete. This is also how my desk looked over the next 3-ish days when I was working on it! This is where I had stopped for Day 1; I had to eat dinner and do some raiding in FFXIV.

![Almost finished left side of the 3d bookend.](/assets/img/blog/sakura4.png)

This is the state of the left side at about 75% completion. It's missing the top of the roof and a few smaller details!

![Almost finished right side of the 3D bookend.](/assets/img/blog/sakura5.png)

Bit of a jump here - this is the right side mostly completed. I believe this must've been cut slightly wrong, because I had MASSIVE issues with trying to fit the tower into the holes here! It did all work out in the end, but I had to sand down quite a few edges... If you look close here, I also forgot 2 pieces on the upper floor - the middle walls, specifically. I only noticed it was I finished the entire bookend and went. Huh. Why are there still pieces here.

Oh my goodness. Wiring this thing was SO scary. I was so afraid that, when I turned it on, it was gonna explode or something!! But no, I did it all perfectly!! It turns on and all the lights are so pretty... I love the little wooden cat and girl, they're so cute! This was such a fun project to put together, and it took about... 10 or so hours over 3 or so days, which writing that down, makes me seem kind of pathetic LMAO. But it was a lot of fun, even if I struggled a lot with it!

Whenever I look at the bookend, it makes my heart feel all warm and squishy. I am loved.

Anyway, that's it from my week (even though its more like a month...)!

Thank you for reading, and keep safe out there. I love you!
